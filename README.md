# Socket.io Testing Grounds


I am using a forked repo of chat-example from socket.io to experiment and learn about socket.io and it's conventions.


This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.
